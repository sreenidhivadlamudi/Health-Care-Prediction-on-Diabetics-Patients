# Health Care Prediction on Diabetic Patients
## Context
This dataset originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
Its primary objective is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on specific diagnostic measurements.

The dataset focuses on female patients who are:

At least 21 years old

Of Pima Indian heritage

## Problem Statement

The goal is to build a machine learning model with high accuracy to predict whether patients in the dataset have diabetes.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes various medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome).

## Predictor Variables

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg / (height in m)²)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)

Age: Age in years

Target Variable

## Outcome:

0 → Non-diabetic

1 → Diabetic

## Dataset Insights

Total records: 768 patients

Positive cases (Outcome = 1): 268 (indicating diabetes)

Negative cases (Outcome = 0): 500

## Project Objective

This dataset provides a valuable opportunity to develop a predictive model for diabetes based on demographic and health-related features.
